You will hear classical chamber music performances throughout the day, and audience members may interact with our performers by playing along with selected music.  An Oakland Symphony Chorus member will lead the “Body Music” interludes and show people how to make music using the one instrument you always have with you: your body!  Judith will lead you in making songs using the voice, hands, feet, maybe even your teeth and fingernails! The EBPA education team will also share information about our upcoming education programming. East Bay Performing Arts (EBPA) brings together orchestral music, choral music, and youth education to strengthen the East Bay community by providing quality live performances, and education for lifetime enrichment.",

        "ProjectDescription": "PIXEL is an open-source, interactive framed LED wall display that allows you to send animations and images from an Android device or Windows PC.  Kickstarted in March 2013, PIXEL consists of a framed two-way acrylic mirror that houses a programmable, 32-by-32 LED matrix array (quick math: that’s 1,024 RGB LED lights), providing ample room to serve as your digital canvas for creating pixel art. Think of pixel art as Pointillism painting (using painted dots of individual colors to create an image) with tons of LEDs. Pixel art was an interesting phase for games and other mediums because it’s ‘8-bit’ style required a bit of imagination on the part of the user to “fill in the blanks”. Until the 90s, this was par for the course for computer and video games alike, but as graphics improved, pixel art was pushed out of the mainstream. The 8-bit pixel artform is experiencing an exciting resurgence, PIXEL brings this art form to the LED medium.",

        "ProjectDescription": "The Tea Engine is a robotically-controlled tea service which allows the user to select how she wishes her tea to be served by selecting the appropriate numeral from the dial.  The Tea Engine was built from an antique silver-plated coffee percolator from the mid-1920s.  Although the percolator requires 110V AC to heat the water and brew the tea, the tea, milk, and sugar valves only require 12V from a small battery hidden under the base of the sugar bowl.  Any type of tea may be brewed; however, the Tea Engine can only serve one type of tea at a time (our preference is for Earl Grey).  The serving of tea is controlled by an antique rotary telephone dial (originally a telephone lineman’s testing unit).  Rotary telephones work by sending a number of electrical pulses corresponding to the number that one dials.  An Arduino microcontroller, a popular open-source microcontroller platform designed for prototyping and tinkering, is concealed inside the telephone dial.  The Arduino chip reads the number of pulses dialed, and sends a signal to serve tea, milk, or sugar.  The tea, milk, and sugar unit each have an electrically-controlled solenoid valve which is restricting the liquid from pouring out.  When the valve receives a signal from the Arduino, it opens for a set number of seconds to dispense the proper amount of tea, milk, or sugar.",
