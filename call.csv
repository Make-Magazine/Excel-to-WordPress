The Tea Engine was built from an antique silver-plated coffee percolator from the mid-1920s.  Although the percolator requires 110V AC to heat the water and brew the tea, the tea, milk, and sugar valves only require 12V from a small battery hidden under the base of the sugar bowl.  Any type of tea may be brewed; however, the Tea Engine can only serve one type of tea at a time (our preference is for Earl Grey).  The serving of tea is controlled by an antique rotary telephone dial (originally a telephone lineman’s testing unit).  Rotary telephones work by sending a number of electrical pulses corresponding to the number that one dials.  An Arduino microcontroller, a popular open-source microcontroller platform designed for prototyping and tinkering, is concealed inside the telephone dial.  The Arduino chip reads the number of pulses dialed, and sends a signal to serve tea, milk, or sugar.  The tea, milk, and sugar unit each have an electrically-controlled solenoid valve which is restricting the liquid from pouring out.  When the valve receives a signal from the Arduino, it opens for a set number of seconds to dispense the proper amount of tea, milk, or sugar.",,http://www.tested.com/tech/robots/454225-meet-mechanical-mixologists-barbot-2013/item/barbot12/,Engineering,Katherine,Becvar,,bluem00ndesigns,katherine@blue-moon-designs.com,654 60th Street,Oakland,CA,94609Rad Dads and Hip Mamas,"You know that being a Rad Dad or Hip Mama is about putting your politics into practice in the most important of areas: your family.

Individual living cells contain intricate networks of molecules that resemble logic gates,  raising the question of how much a single cell might be able to think or compute.  In fact, cells can be viewed as intelligent autonomous robots capable, in many cases, of exploring their environment and responding in an adaptive fashion.   We wanted to apply tools of behavioral psychology to study the behavior of single free-living cells, and asking whether cell behavior shows any of the same features as animal behavior.   Learning has been demonstrated in Stentor coeruleus, a giant single cell that can grow up to 1 millimeter long, which makes it easy to work with.   These huge cells are bright blue and swim around in ponds like tiny fish, eating smaller cells as prey.   If you tap a Stentor cell, it contracts into a little ball, and then eventually relaxes and goes back to hunting its prey.   But if you keep tapping it over and over, eventually it learns to ignore the tap.   This is a form of learning called Habituation, often considered the most basic form of learning in animals.  The existence of this behavior in a single cell is tremendously exciting, but it is not easy to study.   The problem is that the usual way of testing habituation in Stentor is to tap them with a glass needle.   This ends up being really hard to do in a consistent way, and so different people get very different results because they tap with different forces and speeds.    To solve these problems,  we built our own machines for testing the behavior of single cells.   The first is an Arduino-controlled fully automated Stentor Habituation Device (SHD) in which a tap is generated with an electromagnet under computer control, allowing us to modify the frequency and duration of the taps.   The second machine we're working on now is a Lego Mindstorms based system that uses servo motors to generate the tapping motion.   In both cases, we show how low cost DIY solutions can be used to test a fundamental unanswered question in Biology - how much can a single cell think!",,,Science,Wallace,Marshall,,,wallace.marshall@ucsf.edu,,San Francisco,CA,94122BioFuel Oasis Biodiesel Station and Urban Farm Store,"BioFuel Oasis: Local Fuel, Local Bees, Local Farms",http://www.biofueloasis.com,http://biofueloasis.com/wp-content/gallery/1441ashby/1biofuel_oasis3.jpg,Homesteading / Sustainability,Annie,Gowan,BioFuel Oasis Cooperative,,biodevas@biofueloasis.com,1441 Ashby Avenue,Berkeley,CA,94702Nous Savons,"Our clothing and jewelry is the type of thing that might happen if you locked up Martha Stewart, Mata Hari, and Rasputin in an attic for 50 years.",www.noussavons.bigcartel.com,http://noussavons.bigcartel.com/product/w12-75,Crafts,Jocelyn,Nguyen,Nous Savons,noussavons,noussavons@gmail.com,456 Rich Street,Oakland,CA,94609Nimby Powerwheels,Nimby's winning entry for the Powerwheels race at Maker Faire San Mateo.
